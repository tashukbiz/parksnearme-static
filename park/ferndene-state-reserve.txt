Along the way, walkers can enjoy the soothing sounds of the burbling creek and the sight of woodland birds flitting through the trees. With some luck, one might even spot a wallaby hiding among the ferns in the dappled sunlight."}],"\n",["$","p","p-2",{"children":"For those interested in the area's geological history, the reserve is part of the Dial Range Reserves, which showcase a diverse range of geological formations, including volcanic, dolerite, conglomerate, and sandstone layers. The region's varied geology supports a rich diversity of vegetation, from stringybark and black peppermint forests on the drier slopes to tall swamp gums and blackwood trees in the damper areas. In springtime, the understorey and heath plants burst into vibrant bloom, adding to the reserve's charm."}],"\n",["$","p","p-3",{"children":"Visitor amenities include picnic tables and a shelter near the car park, providing a comfortable spot to relax and enjoy a meal amidst the natural surroundings.

Additionally, campfires are prohibited, and visitors are encouraged to avoid driving in the reserves at night to protect local wildlife."}],"\n",["$","p","p-4",{"children":"Access to the reserve is straightforward.

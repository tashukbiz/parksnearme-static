13:T6fb,The Alice Springs Telegraph Station marks the very beginning of the town of Alice Springs. Established in 1872 as part of the Overland Telegraph Line, it transmitted messages between Adelaide and Darwin for 60 years and later served as a school for Aboriginal children (the Bungalow). Today, the historical reserve offers a fascinating window into early settler life in Central Australia. The original stone buildings – including the telegraph office, post and stationmaster’s residence, blacksmith shop and store – have been beautifully restored and furnished with artifacts. Visitors can take a guided tour or explore the rooms to see the old telegraph equipment, kitchens with cast-iron stoves, and living quarters as they were. Exhibits and signs explain how the telegraph worked and the challenges of operating in an isolated desert environment. The station is set alongside the usually-dry Todd River in a shady grove of river red gums; a natural spring (the "Alice Spring") is nearby, which gave the site its name. Numerous picnic tables and free gas BBQs are available under the trees, making it a popular local spot for an outing. There are also walking and mountain biking trails radiating from the station – including a section of the Larapinta Trail that starts here – allowing visitors to enjoy the bush scenery and wildlife (wallabies, galahs and perenti lizards) around this oasis. The reserve is easily accessible, just 4 km north of Alice Springs town centre. With its combination of cultural heritage and pleasant outdoor space, the Alice Springs Telegraph Station is a must-see for understanding the area’s history – from the pioneering communication network to the origins of modern Alice Springs – as well as a great place to relax for an afternoon.8:["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-3xl mx-auto p-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold mb-2","children":"Alice Springs Telegraph Station Historical Reserve"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600","children":["Stuart",", ","Alice Springs",", ","NT"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1","children":"Herbert Heritage Dr, Stuart NT 0870, Australia"}],["$","$L12",null,{"parkTitle":"Alice Springs Telegraph Station Historical Reserve","parkSlug":"alice-springs-telegraph-station-historical-reserve"}],false,["$","div",null,{"className":"prose max-w-none mt-4","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$13"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mt-4 text-sm","children":["For more pictures and directions refer to"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=Alice Springs Telegraph Station Historical Reserve,Herbert Heritage Dr, Stuart NT 0870, Australia","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","className":"text-blue-600 underline","children":"Google Maps"}],"."]}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mt-6","children":"Features"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mt-2","children":[["$","li","bbq",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"✅"}],"bbq"]}],["$","li","playground",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"❌"}],"playground"]}],["$","li","shade",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"✅"}],"shade"]}],["$","li","parking",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"✅"}],"parking"]}],["$","li","dog_off_leash",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"❌"}],"dog off leash"]}],["$","li","picnic_tables",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"✅"}],"picnic tables"]}],"$L14"]}],"$L15"]}]

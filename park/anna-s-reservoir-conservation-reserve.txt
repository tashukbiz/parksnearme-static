14:T6f5,Anna’s Reservoir Conservation Reserve is a small but interesting historical site north of Alice Springs. It centers on a natural waterhole which was named by explorer John McDouall Stuart in April 1860 during one of his expeditions attempting to cross the continent. In the arid landscape of Central Australia, Stuart found this large rockhole and it proved critical for replenishing his party’s water supplies. He named it "Anna’s Reservoir" after a friend’s daughter. The waterhole is held in a rocky basin amid low quartzite hills and mulga scrub. Because it retains water well after rains, it later became an important camp for other travelers and pastoralists. Visible around the reservoir are remnants of stonework – these are crude stone and clay aprons and walls built by early settlers (likely in the 1880s) in an attempt to increase the water catchment and retention. While often dry in drought times, after seasonal rainfall the reservoir can still hold a fair amount of water and attracts wildlife (kangaroos, birds). The reserve is quite remote and has no facilities – reaching it involves driving a 4WD track off the Stuart Highway near Aileron. A short walk leads to the rockhole and signage provides some context about Stuart’s journeys and the reservoir’s later uses. Standing at Anna’s Reservoir, one can imagine the relief Stuart’s team felt on finding this oasis and the significance of such water sources for Aboriginal groups and explorers alike. The site is also culturally significant to local Indigenous people, having long been a reliable soak. For those interested in exploration history or seeking a quiet detour, Anna’s Reservoir offers a tangible link to Stuart’s epic expeditions and the challenges of survival in the outback.8:["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-3xl mx-auto p-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold mb-2","children":"Anna's Reservoir Conservation Reserve"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600","children":["Anmatjere",", ","Central Desert",", ","NT"]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1","children":"via Stuart Hwy near Aileron, Anmatjere NT 0872, Australia"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mt-4","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"relative h-96 w-full","children":["$","$L13",null,{"src":"/park-placeholder.jpg","alt":"Placeholder image for Anna's Reservoir Conservation Reserve","fill":true,"className":"object-cover","loading":"lazy"}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose max-w-none mt-4","children":[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$14"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mt-4 text-sm","children":["For more pictures and directions refer to"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=Anna's Reservoir Conservation Reserve,via Stuart Hwy near Aileron, Anmatjere NT 0872, Australia","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","className":"text-blue-600 underline","children":"Google Maps"}],"."]}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mt-6","children":"Features"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mt-2","children":[["$","li","bbq",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"❌"}],"bbq"]}],["$","li","playground",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"❌"}],"playground"]}],["$","li","shade",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"❌"}],"shade"]}],["$","li","parking",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"❌"}],"parking"]}],["$","li","dog_off_leash",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"❌"}],"dog off leash"]}],["$","li","picnic_tables",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":["$L15","picnic tables"]}],"$L16"]}],"$L17"]}]

At the heart of the park is Kings Canyon, a deep sandstone gorge cleaving the George Gill Range. Its walls soar 100–150 meters high, with the floor of the canyon lush in comparison to the surrounding desert – a permanent waterhole and dense plant life in a section aptly named the ",["$","strong","strong-0",{"children":"Garden of Eden"}]," creates a refuge for many species. The most celebrated activity is the ",["$","strong","strong-1",{"children":"Kings Canyon Rim Walk"}],", a 6 km loop trail. Starting with a steep ascent (often nicknamed \"Heartbreak Hill\"), the track then winds around the canyon’s rim, revealing stunning lookouts into the chasm and across rippling orange rock domes known as the ",["$","strong","strong-2",{"children":"Lost City"}]," (they resemble an ancient city’s ruins). A side track descends into the Garden of Eden, where prehistoric cycads and a grove of cabbage palms thrive around a tranquil pool – a surreal contrast to the sunbaked heights above. The Rim Walk usually takes 3–4 hours and is best done in the cool of morning; it’s closed on very hot days for safety. For those wanting a shorter option, the easier Kings Creek Walk follows the canyon floor for about 2 km, ending at a platform with views up to the towering walls. The park also has the less-known but worthwhile ",["$","strong","strong-3",{"children":"Giles Track"}]," (22 km one-way) connecting to Kathleen Springs (a quiet waterhole and cultural site on the south side of the range). Watarrka’s cultural significance is profound, with evidence of continuous Luritja occupation for tens of thousands of years; interpretive signs at Kathleen Springs share a creation story and stockman history. Facilities in the park include a campground and resort nearby (outside the park boundary), picnic areas, and a small information shelter at the rim walk trailhead. Wildlife is abundant especially in cooler times – euro kangaroos, spinifex pigeons, and sometimes dingoes are spotted. Watching sunrise or sunset light up Kings Canyon’s walls is unforgettable. Watarrka is often considered a must-see along with Uluru and Kata Tjuta, completing the Red Centre’s trilogy of natural wonders with its unique combination of adventure, scenery, and serenity high above the desert floor."]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mt-4 text-sm","children":["For more pictures and directions refer to"," ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=Watarrka National Park,Luritja Rd, Petermann NT 0872, Australia","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener noreferrer","className":"text-blue-600 underline","children":"Google Maps"}],"."]}],["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold mt-6","children":"Features"}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mt-2","children":[["$","li","bbq",{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm","children":["$L13","bbq"]}],"$L14","$L15","$L16","$L17","$L18","$L19"]}],"$L1a"]}]
